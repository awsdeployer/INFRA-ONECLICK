# Microservices System: Full Explanation (with DevOps Focus)

## 1. High-Level Overview

This project is a **microservices-based system** designed for cloud-native deployment, automation, monitoring, and infrastructure management. Each microservice is developed, built, and deployed independently, following best DevOps and cloud-native practices.

**Key Points:**
- Each microservice is in its own repository (in production), but here they are in one workspace for reference.
- All services are containerized (Docker) and orchestrated using Kubernetes.
- Infrastructure, deployment, scaling, and security are managed as code.

---

## 2. Microservices Breakdown

### 2.1 AUTODEPLOY-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Automates deployment of applications (likely to AWS/Kubernetes).
- **Backend:** Python (`backend/deployer/app.py`), dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- **Frontend:** Static web files (`deployer_frontend/`).
- **Kubernetes:** Manifests for deployment, scaling (HPA), network policies, RBAC, and services.
- **DevOps:** Dockerfile for backend, manifests for infra as code, version tracking with `GIT_SHA.txt`.

### 2.2 AWS-CB-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Handles AWS CodeBuild or similar CI/CD tasks.
- **Backend:** Python (`backend/app.py`).
- **Frontend:** Static files and a React login app (`frontend/`, `login/`).
- **Kubernetes:** Manifests for deployment, scaling, network, RBAC, and services.
- **DevOps:** Dockerfile, manifests, version tracking.

### 2.3 HISTORY-SERVICE-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Manages historical data (logs, audit).
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot, see `history-services/`).
- **Database:** Embedded DB (`data/`).
- **Kubernetes:** Manifests for deployment, scaling, RBAC, and services.
- **DevOps:** Dockerfile, manifests, version tracking.

### 2.4 INFRA-ONECLICK

- **Purpose:** Automates infrastructure provisioning (namespace, ingress, persistent volumes).
- **Scripts:** Shell script (`script.sh`).
- **Kubernetes:** Manifests for namespace, ingress, PV.
- **DevOps:** All infra as code, one-click setup.

### 2.5 MONITOR-LOGS-MICROSERVICE

- **Purpose:** Centralized log monitoring and aggregation.
- **Backend:** Python (`database/app.py`).
- **Database:** Models and requirements in `database/`.
- **Kubernetes:** Manifests for deployment, scaling, network, RBAC, secrets, services, statefulset.
- **DevOps:** Dockerfile, manifests, version tracking.

## 3. How the System Works (End-to-End)

1. **Development:**  
   Each microservice is developed independently, with its own codebase, dependencies, and documentation.

2. **Containerization:**  
   Each service has a Dockerfile. The code is packaged into a Docker image, ensuring consistency across environments.

3. **Infrastructure as Code:**  
   All Kubernetes resources (deployments, services, HPA, RBAC, network policies, secrets) are defined as YAML manifests. This makes the infrastructure reproducible and version-controlled.

4. **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   (Implied by naming and structure) Each repo can have its own pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild) to automate:
   - Linting and testing
   - Building Docker images
   - Pushing images to a registry
   - Deploying to Kubernetes

5. **Deployment:**  
   - Use `kubectl apply -f k8s/` to deploy each service.
   - HPA ensures services scale based on demand.
   - Network policies and RBAC enforce security.

6. **Monitoring & Logging:**  
   - MONITOR-LOGS-MICROSERVICE aggregates logs.
   - StatefulSets and persistent volumes ensure log data is durable.

7. **Access & Frontend:**  
   - Some services expose web UIs (static or React).
   - Ingress and services manage external/internal access.

## 4. DevOps Best Practices in This Project

### 4.1 Microservice Isolation

- Each service is self-contained, with its own code, dependencies, and deployment pipeline.
- Enables independent scaling, deployment, and updates.

### 4.2 Containerization

- Dockerfiles for each backend ensure consistent environments.
- Images can be built and run anywhere (local, cloud, CI/CD).

### 4.3 Infrastructure as Code

- All Kubernetes resources are defined as YAML files.
- Enables version control, code review, and reproducibility.

### 4.4 Automated Deployment & Scaling

- Use of HPA for auto-scaling based on resource usage.
- CI/CD pipelines automate build, test, and deploy steps.

### 4.5 Security

- RBAC restricts access to Kubernetes resources.
- Network policies limit pod-to-pod communication.
- Secrets are managed via Kubernetes secrets.

### 4.6 Monitoring & Logging

- Centralized log aggregation for observability.
- Use of persistent storage for logs.

### 4.7 Versioning & Traceability

- `GIT_SHA.txt` tracks the exact code version deployed.
- Each deployment is traceable to a specific commit.

### 4.8 Documentation & Onboarding

- Each service has a README.
- Clear folder structure and naming conventions.
